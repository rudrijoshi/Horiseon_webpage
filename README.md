# 01  Horiseon webpage

## Description

This project was undertaken as part of the UofT Coding Bootcamp and involved the refactoring of a website for a marketing agency. The primary goal was to create a codebase that adheres to accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines.

As a marketing agency, we aimed to have a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our website can be effectively optimized for search engines.

The webpage meets accessibility standards.The source code consists of semantic HTML elements.The HTML elements maintain a logical structure that is independent of styling and positioning.All icon and image elements have accessible "alt" attributes.The heading attributes follow a sequential order.The title element provides a concise and descriptive title for the webpage.By achieving these criteria, we have enhanced the accessibility, structure, and search engine optimization (SEO) of the marketing agency's website, providing a better user experience and improved discoverability.

## Getting Started

To visit the website, just enter the web address in your preferred web browser. After the website loads, you'll land on the homepage. From there, explore various sections of the site by utilizing the top menu bar.
